                    Perhaps it’s time some of sport’s more overlooked events had their chance to shine in 2019.
                    World Championship Scotch Pie Awards, anyone?

                    At the start of what is going to be, at least
                    numerically speaking, an odd year, we look ahead to 12 months with no men’s football World Cup
                    or European Championship; a time when, away from the lush pastures of the world’s most popular
                    and attention-demanding sport, the often icy and ignored playing fields of a few different disciplines
                    can finally receive the focus they deserve.

                    The men’s Cricket World Cup starts in May and the rugby version in September, but there is no need to
                    go so long in search of global competition when alternative events already abound like so much January
                    snowfall. Starting with the Men’s Handball World Championship, co-hosted by “the two handball-loving
                    countries of Germany and Denmark”, which starts on Thursday.

                    For all that the event is about pitting nation against nation in very literally hand-to-hand combat,
                    it is imbued with a spirit of cooperation that does not end with the harmonious hosts. The German singer
                    Dominik Klein – not to be confused with the German international handball player Dominik Klein, even
                    though he seems to have been chosen quite deliberately for that purpose – collaborated with the Danish
                    DJ Kongsted to record the official song, the suitably energetic Stand Up Stand Out (“Full arenas and the
                    best handball in the world need a song that gets us all excited and ready to party,” says Klein) while
                    the mascot was designed “partly by fans” after a global crowdsourcing initiative.

                    This might have been a tactical error. They ended up with a moon-faced humanoid called Stan, who looks
                    like Frank Sidebottom has just joined the Power Rangers. Stan, it turns out, is a visitor from the fictional
                    planet GD19 where “most days we just celebrate, dance and sing”. The German handball association started
                    its press release introducing Stan with the assertion that “mascots have always been born of strange ideas”
                    and it is certainly true of theirs.

                    January, however, is full of events that do not need an outsized alien to get people muttering about strange
                    ideas. Take the World Ice Fishing Championship, which starts in Batak, Bulgaria, in a fortnight, and involves
                    contestants drilling access to a frozen lake and attempting to coax fish from its frigid depths by rapidly wiggling
                    their miniature rods. “This sport is very interesting,” said the Russian Nikolai Volodin after he came 76th in
                    2017. “Chess on ice, you could say.”
